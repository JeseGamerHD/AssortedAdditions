[B]v0.1.1.2[/B]

[LIST]
[*] Added Boss Checklist support
[*] Fire Dragon boss improvements: It now flies a lot faster when going straight, but turns slower. Also tweaked the attack pattern to change states faster and slightly increased max health and defense
[*] All swords now allow the player to turn while swinging
[*] Reduced the spawn chance of Haunted Pots by around 33%
[*] Cosmic Tome's projectiles now work underground (tile collision logic similar to starfury)
[*] Shooting Star (bow) projectiles are now homing
[*] Phantasmic Blade's & Phantasmic Bow's projectiles no longer hit friendly NPCs
[*] Added a shader trail to Draconic Bow's projectile
[*] Improved steel weapon/tool sprites
[*] Assigined "DamageType" to some weapons that had it missing (They should now show up on lists that rely on this info). The weapons in question did not deal damage themselves, but their projectiles did so the damage values are still going to be the same.
