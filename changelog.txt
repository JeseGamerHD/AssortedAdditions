[B]v0.1.0.5[/B]

[LIST]
[*] Fixed Rune of Death not giving proper immunity to Flame Traps. Apparently the traps shoot two different types of projectile and the rune gave immunity to one of them.
[*] Cleaned up the localization at the Projectiles section.
[*] Updates to Fire Drakes: They now spawn during hardmode in the underworld (previously only during the Fire Dragon fight). Their health was sligthly increased, a new sound was added, they drop Ancient Tokens.
[*] Slightly reduced Goblin Balloonist's health.
[*] Added a message that appears in chat when unlocking the Mysterious Chest (with the key) to indicate that the Wizard has some new stock.
