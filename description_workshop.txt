[h1]What is the mod about?[/h1]
Assorted Additions is a content mod which adds all sorts of things like the name implies. The mod started from the question of "how hard could making a mod be" and kept expanding as new ideas came up. 

Currently the mod adds:
[list]
    [*] Over 200 new items!
    [*] 15 enemies
    [*] 2 Bosses
    [*] New category of accessory called "Runes"
    [*] Bunch of tweaks such as improved loot for underground biome chests (mushroon, granite etc.), alternative ways of obtaining some accessories and non-consumable summoning items
[/list]

The mod does not have a proper wiki, however, an overview of the progression/class setups can be found on this [url=https://github.com/JeseGamerHD/AssortedAdditions/blob/master/ClassSetups.md]GitHub page[/url]. 
The GitHub repository also contains [url=https://github.com/JeseGamerHD/AssortedAdditions/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#navigating-the-github-page]information[/url] on individual items and changes to some extent.

The mod should work in multiplayer (some desync). It should also be compatible with other mods for the most part. There are configs for things that could cause issues.
